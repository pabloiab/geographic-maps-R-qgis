#MAKING A MAP WITH SHAPEFILE IN R


##Recommendations: 

###Save the R script, the shapefile (.shp), and the Excel file with the coordinates in the same folder. 

###Set the working directory: Session/Set Working Directory/To Source File Location.

###Follow the steps explained in the R script "map_R_with_shapefile_piab.R"

###I found the shapefile with its dependencies in https://youtu.be/Hkl0Lf6x__A?si=dCfsxrVF0-xMFvat. Thanks to Julia Loj√°n for this resource!

###The coordinates were chosen randomly by me. I suggest uploading the Excel file with the coordinates to Google maps before using the R script to first visualize where the points are located on the map.

###I wrote the script "map_R_with_shapefile_piab.R". Hope it works for you with your data points and shapefiles. 

###Plotting a map in R with ggplot2 result me useful to have the same shapes, colours, and size that I use in genetic analysis such as PCAs, MDS plots, haplotype networks and compare it with the map.
