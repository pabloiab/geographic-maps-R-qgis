##MAKING A MAP WITH SHAPEFILE IN R


##Recommendations: 
###Save the R script, the shapefile (.shp), and the Excel file with the coordinates in the same folder. 
###Set the working directory: Session/Set Working Directory/To Source File Location.

###Follow the steps explained in the R script "map_R_with_shapefile_piab.R"

###Plotting a map in R with ggplot2 result me useful to have the same shapes, colours, and size that I use in genetic analysis such as PCAs, MDS plots, haplotype networks and so on.
